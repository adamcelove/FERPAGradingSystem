Awaiting next task

## Next
Task 4.2.1: Final quality checkpoint (Phase 4: Quality Gates)

## Learnings
- Project structure mismatch: pyproject.toml expects src/ferpa_feedback/ but files are at root level
- Stage 2 (name verification) is imported in pipeline.py but does not exist - will cause runtime crash
- Stage 4 (semantic analysis) and Stage 5 (human review) are designed in README/models but not implemented
- Two incompatible StudentComment definitions: dataclass in stage_0_ingestion_improved.py vs Pydantic in models.py
- Dependencies GLiNER and rapidfuzz are listed but not actually used - intended for Stage 2
- Presidio can boost F-score ~30% with proper configuration - current setup uses defaults
- LanguageTool cold start takes 10-30 seconds - lazy loading pattern already partially implemented
- FERPA Gate pattern (detect -> anonymize -> re-detect) is well-designed for compliance
- Educational PII detection benefits from context-aware approaches vs generic NER (PIIvot research)
- Recall is more important than precision for PII detection - prefer catching false positives
- P0 priority items: project structure fix, Stage 2 implementation, model unification - all block pipeline from running
- rapidfuzz not installed in environment - Stage 2 stub handles gracefully with fallback matching
- User story approach: 8 stories covering structural fixes, missing features, and optimizations
- FERPA Gate enforcement is critical for Stage 4 - must verify no PII reaches external API
- Stage 5 review UI depends on FastAPI optional dependency - consider mandatory if required
- Name edge cases (O'Brien, McDonald, hyphenated) need explicit test coverage
- 95% PII recall target aligns with regulatory best practices for educational data
- Architecture decision: GLiNER primary + spaCy fallback for Stage 2 NER - both already in deps
- FERPAEnforcedClient wrapper pattern ensures single enforcement point for API calls
- Custom Presidio recognizers needed for StudentID, GradeLevel, SchoolName patterns
- token_sort_ratio algorithm best for name matching with order variations (John Smith vs Smith, John)
- Factory function pattern (create_*) must be preserved for consistency with existing stages
- Frozen Pydantic models require returning new instances from all processors
- Name normalization handles apostrophes (O'Brien->obrien), hyphens (Smith-Jones->smithjones), and suffixes (Jr., III)
- Nickname expansion table maps 50+ common nicknames to formal names bidirectionally
- Migration path: 6 phases from structure fix through CLI polish
- Task planning: 42 total tasks across 4 phases (POC, Refactoring, Testing, Quality Gates)
- Quality checkpoints inserted every 2-3 tasks to catch issues early
- POC phase focuses on making pipeline runnable with stubs before full implementation
- Stage 0 requires adapter work: dataclass StudentComment must be replaced with Pydantic version
- Stage 2 stub allows pipeline to run while full GLiNER/rapidfuzz implementation follows
- Critical dependency: Stage 4 MUST receive FERPA gate to prevent PII leakage
- Test coverage target: 80% for critical stages (2, 3, 4)
- Integration test must verify "no PII reaches API" as compliance requirement
- Python 3.9 compatibility: Use Optional[X] and Union[X, Y] instead of X | Y syntax (requires Python 3.10+)
- GLiNER not installed in environment - GLiNERExtractor implemented with graceful fallback to empty list behavior
- NameMatcher confidence thresholds aligned with design: HIGH >= 90, MEDIUM >= threshold (85), LOW < threshold
- CLI uses typer with rich progress indicators for user-friendly feedback during processing
- POC Phase 1 complete: FeedbackPipeline instantiates successfully with all 6 stages (0-5) - end-to-end validation passed
- Custom Presidio recognizers use stub Pattern/PatternRecognizer classes when presidio_analyzer not installed - allows import without runtime error
- PIIDetector gracefully handles missing presidio: create_enhanced_analyzer returns None, detector disables presidio and falls back to regex patterns
- Added STUDENT_ID_BARE regex pattern (S\d{7,9}) to built-in patterns for student ID detection without presidio dependency
- CompletenessAnalyzer uses exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s) for API resilience with doubled delays for rate limits
- Claude API response parsing handles both raw JSON and markdown code block formats
- Completeness scoring uses weighted average: specificity 25%, actionability 25%, evidence 20%, length 15%, tone 15%
- API fallback pattern: graceful degradation to stub result when API unavailable or all retries exhausted
- ConsistencyAnalyzer follows same pattern as CompletenessAnalyzer: retry logic, JSON parsing, API call with ZDR headers
- Grade-comment consistency uses sentiment alignment detection: positive grades expect positive comments, low grades expect concern-addressing comments
- Confidence level for consistency determined by sentiment clarity: HIGH when sentiments clearly match/mismatch, MEDIUM when ambiguous
- FastAPI review UI uses optional import pattern: try/except ImportError with helpful install message for optional dependency
- Review UI endpoints: GET / for HTML list, POST /review/{id} for status updates, GET /export for approved JSON
- CLI review command uses try/except pattern for optional uvicorn and FastAPI dependencies with helpful error message
- HTML form submission for review uses Query parameters for FastAPI route handling
- Warmup command forces lazy-load of LanguageTool by accessing checker.tool property, then verifies with a test check
- Dependency audit complete: All 17 dependencies documented. GLiNER and rapidfuzz confirmed in stage_2_names.py. Some deps reserved for future (google-api, pydantic-settings, pandas)
- Test infrastructure: conftest.py provides fixtures for StudentComment, TeacherDocument, ClassRoster with various states (minimal, with PII, anonymized, with grammar issues, needs review)
- Test fixture strategy: JSON fixture for sample comments, CSV for roster data - matches expected input formats
- NameMatcher.match_score is normalized to 0-1 range (score/100), while threshold and confidence classification use 0-100 scale internally
- PII recall test corpus contains 21 test cases with 26 expected PII instances covering EMAIL, PHONE, SSN, STUDENT_ID, STUDENT_ID_BARE, and DATE types
- PIIDetector regex patterns achieve 100% recall on test corpus - all 26 PII instances detected correctly
- False positive documentation is informational only (no test failure) - FERPA prioritizes high recall over low FP rate
- FERPA gate treats empty string anonymized_text as "no content" and blocks it - security-conscious default behavior (Python truthiness)
- Semantic analysis mocking: inject mock client via `client._client = mock_client` after FERPAEnforcedClient init, mock response structure requires `content[0].text` and `model` attributes
- Integration tests require roster for name detection when Presidio is not installed - roster-based patterns are the primary name detection mechanism
- Test names must not conflict with placeholder patterns (e.g., "Student" appears in "[STUDENT_NAME_1]") - use names like "Alex Chen" instead of "Sensitive Student"
- Critical compliance test (NFR-6): 15 integration tests verify no PII reaches API, covering pipeline flow, FERPA gate, and semantic analysis blocking
- Phase 3 Testing complete: 140 tests passing, 2 skipped (GLiNER-specific), 52% overall coverage with critical stages at 70-73% coverage
- Mypy strict mode fixes: 55 type errors resolved across 8 files (recognizers/educational.py, stage_0/1/2/3/4/5, pipeline.py)
- Type annotation patterns: Use `Any` base class with `# type: ignore[misc]` for dynamic class hierarchies, `cast()` for config dict returns
- Untyped FastAPI decorators require `# type: ignore[untyped-decorator]` comments in strict mode
- Ruff auto-fix handles 168+ style issues (import sorting, Optional->X|None, List->list). Manual fixes needed for B904 (raise from), SIM102 (combine nested ifs)
- B008 (typer function calls in defaults) is standard typer pattern - added to ruff ignore list. Ruff config moved from top-level to `[tool.ruff.lint]` section to fix deprecation warning
- Python 3.9 compatibility: Ruff auto-converts Optional[X] to X | None, but this syntax requires Python 3.10+. Fix by adding `from __future__ import annotations` to enable PEP 563 postponed evaluation
- Typer runtime evaluation: Even with `from __future__ import annotations`, typer evaluates type hints at runtime. Must use `Optional[Path]` instead of `Path | None` for typer parameters
- Presidio PatternRecognizer API: Real Presidio uses `get_supported_entities()` method, not `supported_entity` attribute like the stub class
