COMMENT TEXT:
Will and I have gotten to know each other quickly over the course of the school year; being in the same group on Founders Day certainly helped cement a growing partnership that we seem to be developing. Our "secret" handshake is in its nascent stages of development and we have come to a greater understanding of what is and is not a productive contribution to the classroom. On his assessments Will had a slow start to the year, performing below his expectations on a few of the early assessments, but as the year has progressed Will has seemed to get a better sense of what is expected of him in the class, performing well on his most recent assessment (92%) compared to his previous scores, (72%, 86%, 86%). I think that he is on a positive trajectory and I hope he will continue that trend.  Will reached out to come to meet with me after his assessment on Velocity claiming that "I had put the wrong equation on the test" I had offered for him to come in and discuss so that we could see what happened. As it turned out he had made a simple mistake that he saw as soon as we started reviewing his test. He had made the same mistake on a separate problem, but I do not take off points multiple times for the same mistake, so his grade was only affected by the first instance. Will has had moments where he has been seeking attention from his classmates in ways that are detrimental to the overall learning of the classroom. The good news is that despite some notable moments at the start of the year, it seems that Will has begun a turn for the better as the year has gone on. Will certainly has a talent for making his friends laugh. I hope that he will be able to utilize that power for good, finding the right moments to insert some levity rather than during moments requiring focus and attention from the class. I encourage Will to come meet with me outside of class again during our shared free block so that he can clear up any points of confusion before our next assessment rather than after. I really enjoy having Will in my class and I am looking forward to the rest of the year together!

STUDENT: Coley, Brennan
GRADE: A+
Issues Found: 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Brennan has been an outstanding member of our physics class. Already knowing Brennan from Cross country I know that he is an incredibly hard worker and committed to his own improvement. It does not come as any surprise that that same level of commitment would also translate into his academic work. Brennan has been an excellent participant in class, showing that he is paying close attention and applying the knowledge to his assessments. For the first weeks of class Brennan had a 100% and only recently broke his streak.   Brennan only missed some small details, mistaking a + for a - sign on his most recent assessment but the overall understanding that he has shown has been excellent throughout. I encourage Brennan to keep up the good work!

COMMENT TEXT:
Trip has been committed to his studies from the start of the interim. Making an effort to reach out to me to make sure that he was completing all of his work, was making good preparations for his upcoming assessments, and was preparing effectively and meeting with me before one of his assessments to make sure that he was understanding correctly. Trip's hard work and attention to detail has paid off, he scored highly on all of  his assessments . I encourage Trip to continue to reach out for clarification, continue to utilize the resources of the class, and to reach out for help when needed. I am looking forward to the rest of the semester!

STUDENT: Farrell, Bobby
GRADE: A
Issues Found: 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Bobby has had a strong first interim. Bobby will pick his moments to contribute to discussions asking pointed questions and offering his thoughts. Bobby has shown good understanding on assessments, often finishing quickly. Bobby has been able to show his work efficiently, but perhaps too efficiently, showing correct calculations with values; I ask that Bobby take his time and show more of what he understands on the page, writing down relationships in terms of variables first before plugging in specific numbers from a problem. I hope that Bobby will continue to speak up in class as his contributions are often valuable. and I hope that he will take his time and show his understanding fully on upcoming assessments as well as other contributions.

STUDENT: Lamb, David
GRADE: A
Issues Found: 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
David has had a strong first interim, showing good understanding throughout the interim and having a particularly strong showing on his last assessment. managing to solve the challenge problem at the end using a valid, albeit much longer method to extrapolate the motion of a speeding car beyond the given information. I encourage David to continue to try creative solutions to problems and see how he can apply his math skills to more problems that we encounter. David has done well to resist the distractions of peers around him, maintaining focus even while his peers may be seeking his attention. MacPhail, Jake - Jake has been a solid member of the class, keeping up with assignments and reaching out to make sure that he has been keeping up with the current material. Jake is great at asking questions during class time. His questions often show that he is thinking deeply, considering the work that we are doing and identifying a specific part that he is getting stuck at. Jake has shown that he is getting the big picture on many of his assessments, the few points that he has missed often come from small details, applying a formula incorrectly, missing a sign or mistaking units. I encourage Jake to try to ask the same good questions of his own work, going over his responses and asking himself if he has included all of the necessary details. I am looking forward to the remainder of the first semester with Jake!

STUDENT: Nachand, Henry
GRADE: A-
Issues Found: 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Henry and I have seemed to develop a good rapport over the first interim. Henry always seems to have a smile on his face, is very personable and has shown that he is a very capable student with his work on class time activities, labs and assessments. I would encourage Henry to continue to consider some of his class time behavior more closely. I am sure that Henry hasn't been intentional in trying to be discouraging but I have heard him make some offhand comments to his neighbor during problem solving, when he noticed a mistake in his partner's work. I would encourage Henry to reconsider our guidelines for peer feedback: specific, helpful and kind so that he can provide kind and encouraging assistance especially to someone he considers a friend. Early in the interim Henry and his friend seemed to consistently strike up a conversation as soon as I would turn my back when I was presenting to the class. After pointing this out to them, they both seemed to get the message that side conversations during class time, even when the teacher's back is turned, are not appropriate. I have seen good improvement since I pointed out what I had noticed to Henry. Overall, I have very much enjoyed having Henry as a student. After his most recent absence Henry was very diligent to make a meeting to review material that he missed and prepared for the most recent assessment which he performed well on. I look forward to the rest of the semester with Henry!

STUDENT: Perko, Sebastian
GRADE: B
Issues Found: 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Sebastian made a good effort to make up a lab that he had missed at the start of the interim, making an appointment to come outside of class to gather his data, make the necessary measurements and write up his report after missing school for a few days. Sebastian struggled on his most recent assessment on acceleration, showing some weakness on the graphing portion as well as with definitions that were reviewed in the prior class. Sebastian has seemed confused during portions of class at least from his expressions but rarely asks a question for clarification. I encourage Sebastian to ask more questions during class when he is confused and to reach out for help outside of class when he is feeling persistent confusion. I am always available to meet the opposite lunch. Sebastian has at times struggled with staying focused during class time often leaning back in his chair rather than taking notes or practicing the skill we are investigating. I encourage Sebastian to "lean in" both literally and figuratively in class so that he doesn't miss important details. I hope that Sebastian and I can continue to partner in his development.

STUDENT: Samuel, Landon
GRADE: B-
Issues Found: 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Landon has been a positive member of the classroom aside from a few chuckles at inappropriate times and trying to draw the attention of friends from across the room Landon has been an engaged member of the classroom. When Landon gets down to work he works with focus and purpose. Outside of class Landon is easy to talk to and get along with. Landon has struggled a fair bit on his assessments, having trouble applying many of the skills of the class. On his most recent assessment Landon was asked about features on a specific graph and what they represented. Landon gave general responses that were true for a graph in general but were not applicable to the specific graph that we had been working with for the past few weeks showing that he was perhaps missing an important connection between describing the motion of an object and how it connects to the features of the graph of that same motion. I hope that Landon will reach out to make a meeting with me to review concepts that he is struggling with. I know that Landon is a capable student and that he is working hard to improve. I am here to help meet whatever goals Landon has for his performance in the class.

STUDENT: Thomas, TJ
GRADE: B-
Issues Found: 5
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
I have really enjoy having TJ in my class, he is a wonderful presence in the room and is always respectful and ready to learn. I encourage TJ to talk readily with his partner and try to work through problems together especially if he is unsure. TJ struggled on his most recent assessment on acceleration. I had provided a video on how to draw graphs which was direct practice for the first part of the quiz. I encourage TJ to go back and review that material as that will be a skill that we will continue to use throughout the coming units. I have noticed that he has been slow to come back from breaks at times and has had a habit of forgetting to place his phone in the holder at the start of class though he has improved as the interim has continued. I encourage TJ to focus on making sure that he is taking care of the basics, showing up to class on time, placing his phone in the holder right away and having his notes out and ready right at the start of class. I hope that TJ will reach out to me if he feels like he needs some additional review before assessments, will take the opportunity to review with his partner during group work time as well as utilize all of the resources available to him outside of class time.

STUDENT: Vaidya, Dylan
GRADE: A
Issues Found: 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Dylan has been a committed from the start of the year. Dylan stated that he intended to approach all of his classes with focus and hard work applying himself fully to his studies from the start. Dylan has certainly backed up his words with action. Staying focused during class work time, showing good preparation during assessments, writing out his work completely, writing detailed and specific responses to questions, and checking over his work before handing anything in. Dylan's only points of improvement lie in becoming distracted at times by his peers, sometimes laughing along with a joke provided by his classmates but he is quick to refocus when reminded. I hope to see more evidence of Dylan’s commitment to excellence this year!

STUDENT: Wiley, George
GRADE: A
Issues Found: 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
George has been an excellent student this interim. He has been proactive, hard working, and willing to do what it takes to be the author of his own success. George has reached out to meet with me, making meetings before school asking for additional practice, clarifying instructions, and overall giving himself the greatest opportunity to succeed in the class. George has not been shy to contribute to discussions, even volunteering to be one of the first discussion directors for his class, taking on the role with gusto, perhaps even going a bit overboard with the formality that he approached the role with. I encourage George to keep checking in, not to discourage him in his assertive nature but to encourage a measure of questioning before charging ahead and find a balance between stating ideas confidently and expressing a bit of questioning or consideration for where he may need more detail. I look forward to hearing more from George as his understanding in physics progresses!

STUDENT: Wujnovich, Nolan
GRADE: A
Issues Found: 4
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Nolan has been a quiet but diligent member of the class, working well with his partner during group problem solving, showing his work completely during assessments. Nolan participates occasionally during classroom discussions and I would encourage him to ask more questions and share his thoughts more readily, both to solidify thoughts for himself as well as to help his classmates by sharing his explanations with the full class. Nolan's work is often well expressed, specific but he can occasionally miss small details, forgetting to write units or missing a step in a calculation or using a term incorrectly in an explanation. I encourage Nolan to continue with his good in-class habits and perhaps add some more review of his notes outside of class, additional practice writing out solutions fully, and taking time at the end of assessments to check over his work to make sure that he hasn't left out any important details. I am looking forward to the rest of the semester with Nolan! A-Block Physics

COMMENT TEXT:
Burke is attentive, ready to learn every day, and has a bright positive personality. During class time Burke is a great participant in classroom discussions, always contributing when he has an insight to share. I encourage Burke to continue to keep up with practice work and work outside of the classroom. Burke has done well on assessments overall but will miss small details, he could address those small gaps in knowledge with additional review of his notes outside of the class, and more careful reading of the textbook. He can be distracted at times by his neighbors, engaging in some side conversations but is quick to correct when he is reminded. Burke has also needed some reminders to turn in work or to take a missed assessment. I encourage Burke to be proactive, check myUS for any missing assignments. I was happy that I was able to observe Burke diving one day when the cross country team was training in the pool. I hope that Burke will bring some of his diving experience to the class, especially when we discuss rotation and projectile motion.

STUDENT: Childs, Jack
GRADE: B+
Issues Found: 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
When Jack has participated in class he seems to consistently make valuable contributions. He shows that he is thinking clearly and logically when he does speak up or is called on. On assessments Jack struggles to completely show all of his work. On his most recent test it seemed like Jack was falling asleep during the assessment, a challenging situation for any student to perform at their best. Jack is often struggling to stay awake during class. I hope that Jack will reflect on his sleep habits and if he is getting regular restorative sleep over the next interim so that he can come to class ready to learn and participate. Being attentive during class time and using it to practice the skills he needs as well as using the resources available to him outside of the classroom in addition to reaching out for help when needed are all options that are available to Jack.

STUDENT: Coffman, Clayton
GRADE: C+
Issues Found: 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Clayton has been an active participant in class, asking questions to clarify his knowledge and working with his table partner to understand the current material. Clayton shows good understanding in glimpses on his assessments where he is close to a correct definition or application of a concept but is often missing one more step to solidify his knowledge. On his most recent assessment he showed a good understanding of what was happening during a car accelerating but was confusing how to find displacement with how to find acceleration using a graph that he had produced. Clayton has become frustrated at times throughout the interim. I have heard Clayton at times seemingly trying to convince himself that he couldn't possibly understand the material. I encourage Clayton to slow down in these moments of frustration (there are many challenging concepts in physics) and stay open minded about his abilities and practice self-compassion and not come in with the expectation that everything will be understandable the very first time he encounters something new. On his assessments Clayton shows that he is understanding the shape of the problems but can confuse terms and his work can be hard to follow logically. I encourage Clayton to meet with me in the second interim so that we can practice how to best get his thoughts on the page when it comes to assessments.

STUDENT: Dargaj, Giovani
GRADE: B+
Issues Found: 8
----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Gio has been selective with his participation this interim, speaking up only when he has something he is sure of. Often staying quiet during small group discussion times, while he does seem focused on his work, he often doesn't take the opportunity to try to ask questions, or discuss each activity more deeply with his table partner during group work, discussing briefly and then stopping conversation for the remainder of time allotted for group work. I encourage Gio to reach out both in class with questions as well as to make meetings outside of the classroom before assessments to check his knowledge before he is assessed. Gio scored a 21.5/30 on his Forces quiz, indicating that he will need to review those materials as we come back to the skills that we applied on that assessment. I know that Gio is a capable and hard-working student so I hope that he will take advantage of all of the opportunities to learn both in and out of the classroom, coming to meet with me, using online resources provided on the class website, and watching recorded videos for important concepts.

STUDENT: Hayek, Michael
GRADE: A

----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT TEXT:
Michael has shown strength in classroom discussions; when he does offer his thoughts he often has a lot to add to the conversation. Michael can be distracted by peers or engage in conversations during times where focus is required or information is being presented to the class. Michael is often quick to correct when reminded. Michael is working on how to ask clarifying questions neutrally. Rather than starting with something along the lines of "this is where I think you are wrong" Michael can ask a neutral question such as, "I'm confused about ____ part of your graph, can you explain why the shape is like this and not how I drew it?" The more that Michael can approach feedback with neutrality, curiosity and without judgement the more positive his contributions will be to the whole class.

COMMENT TEXT:
Blake has been inconsistent this interim; at times he is focused and ready to learn, asking good questions during classroom discussions, working persistently and collaboratively and constructively with his peers. There are other times where Blake struggles to maintain his composure, making faces at his classmates at inappropriate times, engaging in side conversations and distracting himself and others with anything but the work of the classroom. I encourage Blake to consider his classmates as well as his own learning in the coming months and try to reflect on how he can better serve his learning as well as that of his classmates, particularly in the late afternoon when these issues seem more present. I was encouraged that Blake sought me out to discuss some material outside of class and I hope that Blake will continue to reach out for help before assessments.

COMMENT TEXT:
Having known Asher from cross country for the past 2 years he is no stranger to me. Asher has had a strong interim overall, and while he missed some time due to illness he was quick to catch up. Asher has shown good ability to perform on assessments but will often miss details in his work, forgetting a type of force or the direction that force goes in. Asher seems to be content to sit back during class time and absorb material for himself, rarely discussing his work with his partner for more than a minute, taking the time to sit back rather than taking time to offer an explanation or asking a question of his partner. I encourage Asher to take some time to go a bit further and try to explain his thinking more fully during partner work as he is missing an opportunity both to solidify his own knowledge but also to lend a hand to his classmate and share his understanding. Asher has lately seemed determined to use all of the stuff in the classroom for creative purposes, making constructions out of test dividers, using meter sticks instead of rulers for line drawing in a notebook. I encourage Asher to refocus on the task of being a student and focus on how he is engaging with his peers in the classroom constructively during group work times as well as during whole group discussions.

COMMENT TEXT:
Grant has been an overall positive contributor to the classroom. Contributing to classroom discussions and often providing some flavor to discussions, putting some emotion into his disbelief at a misconception that he has encountered. On assessments Grant has shown strength in expressing his knowledge, writing out his work clearly and constructing complete explanations. Grant has, at times, allowed his enthusiasm to boil over into distraction. Engaging in face making at his classmates during presentation times or trying to distract his peers across the room from him during focused work time. When Grant is focused and working, he does well to discuss his thinking with his partner, stepping through problems logically and consistently. I encourage Grant to consider his peers as well as his own learning during times where he finds himself distracting others during class time. I am looking forward to the rest of the semester with Grant. Honors Physics D

COMMENT TEXT:
Nathan has been a wonderful part of the Honors Physics classroom. He comes in with a smile and positive attitude, ready to learn, participate and learn from his mistakes. Nathan is always willing to start a problem on his own, taking the lead, grabbing a whiteboard marker to write out a problem on the boards, setting up the problem himself before starting a conversation with his classmates and getting their thoughts. While Nathan has missed a lot of class due to Golf, he has been very proactive making appointments to make up his missing work and assessments.  Nathan scored a 45/55 (81.8%) on his assessment on constant velocity and improved greatly on his next assessment, scoring a 36.25/40 (90%) on his following assessment.  I hope to see Nathan continue his trajectory in the class, building on good habits around preparation outside of the classroom and focused work during classroom activities.

COMMENT TEXT:
Phin has had a bit of a rollercoaster start to the interim. Phin started the year with some disappointing scores on his first two assessments (85% and 81%) but showed some significant improvement on his most recent assessment (90%). After his second assessment, Phin committed to taking advantage of the opportunities for physics practice provided on the topics page of the class website. He completed some of the review on his own and then met with me to review some of the problems that he found challenging. His continued practice and review outside of class has shown good results and I encourage Phin to continue to apply the strategies that he has developed in review for the past few weeks. Phin has seemed to become more comfortable with the processes of the class and grown in confidence as he has begun to find out how to practice effectively outside of class. I look forward to the coming semester and I encourage Phin to continue to reach out to me as the year progresses to review any material that he needs clarification on.

COMMENT TEXT:
Sahand is a wonderful part of the Honors Physics classroom. Sahand seems to be comfortable in the class, drawing upon his calculus knowledge to help with the early models that we have built with some facility. Most recently he and his partner worked to find a solution to a challenge problem trying to help me with my basketball shot. They created a model in Desmos to see how their derived equation would work under different conditions and manipulated variables to see how it would function. A great end point for any problem. I encourage Sahand to continue to focus on details, he can sometimes forget to fully write out his steps or not get his full understanding on the page as his verbal explanations show a greater understanding than what is present in his written work. I am looking forward to the rest of the semester with Sahand and encourage him to continue to apply his math, computer, and critical thinking skills to all of our future topics of investigation.

Johnathan has been an active participant in class, comes into class prepared with his notes, and ready to learn. Johnathan brings great energy to the room and is often enthusiastic when given the chance to solve problems on his own. While I see Johnathan sometimes getting into friendly back and forth with his neighbor, at times it can become a bit distracting, mostly to himself. I encourage Johnathan to realize that while competition is something that can make doing well feel fun, that in learning we can all "win" by learning and improving ourselves. Learning is not a zero sum game, and we can enhance our own learning by teaching and helping others rather than trying to best the person next to you.

Griffin is wonderful to have in class. Griffin is interested, committed and genuinely trying to understand the material at a deeper level. He is helpful to his classmates when they are stuck and he is always willing to participate in class. A particular moment of note was when he presented in front of the class during a group discussion, choosing to go to the whiteboard to draw his graph rather than just explain from his seat, not only making it easier for the class to understand his thought process but also proving Griffin's skill and confidence in his physics work. Looking forward to a great rest of the year.

They created a model in Desmos to see how their derived equation would work under different conditions and manipulated variables to see how it would function. A great end point for any problem.

COMMENT TEXT:
Kengston is a wonderful member of the class. He comes to class attentive and ready to learn, he is always willing to take suggestions and has a consistent work ethic, working hard outside of class as well as in. Kengston came to me after his most recent test and expressed some concerns about his standing in the class and the lack of confidence that he felt after the most recent assessment. We spoke at length about the difference between "natural ability" and "experience" when discussing how he felt relative to the other students in the class. I encourage Kengston to focus on listening and trying to understand, rather than comparing himself to others. If it seems like others are explaining a concept easily, that is a great opportunity to try and understand what they understand. Everyone has to traverse the gap between not understanding and understanding, but the more we focus on the frustration, the "I am not getting it" or the "natural ability" of those around us the more that we miss the fact that much of what may appear as "natural ability" is just an expression of understanding that was gained from past experience wrestling with the concepts we are investigating. I encourage Kengston to come and meet with me during our shared free block (G-Block in the Library) in the coming months so that we can review recent material, look ahead to coming topics, and review past knowledge. I look forward to the end of the semester, and I hope that Kengston will reach out for help when he needs it. He is not alone in his journey! I am here to help, and he has resources available to him!

After his most recent assessment which Arnav took after returning from his scheduled absence, I asked Arnav how he was feeling in the class and how he felt on the most recent assessment. He stated that he felt "alright" about the class. I am more than happy to meet with Arnav outside of class if he wants to improve his scores or review past material.

COMMENT TEXT:
It has been interesting seeing Kartik firsthand as a student after only hearing second hand about his experiences in the classroom through his other teachers' comments as his sponsor. Kartik has had some ups and downs this interim, he started out the year with a 16.5/20(82.5%), followed by a 45/55 (81.8%) on his constant velocity assessment and finished with a 32.5/40 (81.3%) on his free fall and vectors assessment. Kartik has at times needed some reminders about staying on task, especially during group problem solving where students are given a bit more freedom. Kartik has found himself getting involved in side conversations, allowing himself to get sidetracked during the times where he can find out what he may not be understanding as fully as he needs to. Additionally there have been a few classes where Kartik seems to be having trouble staying awake during class. I encourage Kartik to again focus on getting good sleep so that he can stay attentive and engaged during class time. Kartik would benefit from regular practice outside of class problem solving, reading through the textbook, taking and reviewing notes, as well as reaching out to meet with me (it's pretty easy to set up a meeting with me at the lunch table). I am here to help Kartik achieve whatever his goals are in Honors Physics!

COMMENT TEXT:
Anton has been an excellent part of the Honors Physics classroom. Anton has seemed to come alive a bit more in class recently when we started investigating some more challenging problems that have ranges of solutions. Anton started building models using both problem solving on paper and then using Desmos to create a computer model of the system to see how the system responded to changes in the various inputs. I hope that Anton will continue to follow this practice, applying the same modeling techniques to the new tools that we will be developing over the coming months, using Forces, Energy, and momentum to model the behavior of more complex systems. Khot, Nishanth - INC Nishanth had a bit of a slow start to the year.  He seemed hesitant to apply himself fully to the tasks of the class choosing to sit back rather than move ahead with writing out his work.  When asked about his thought process Nishanth often had interesting and inventive ways of approaching problems, showing good intuition about how the mathematics could be applied to the systems we were investigating.  On assessments Nishanth took only two of the three large assessments scoring a 18/20 and a 45/55.  I hope to see more of Nishanth getting his good thought on to the page and applying his good mathematical and analytical skills to the upcoming semester!

COMMENT TEXT:
Jarvie has been an excellent student this interim. Jarvie shows good intuition about physics problems, often finding solutions more quickly than he can explain them or write them down effectively. Jarvie has used his strong problem solving skills to approach problems logically and break them down effectively. Jarvie seems to be working on making his work very clear and understandable to a wider audience, commenting that neatness was something that he valued when looking at other people's work. I have seen a big shift in how he has begun presenting his work on the page at the same time. I encourage Jarvie to continue to improve the clarity and neatness of his work. I am looking forward to seeing how Jarvie tackles many of the upcoming challenges in Honors Physics!

COMMENT TEXT:
I have noticed a great amount of improvement in Alex's work over the first Interim, while I think that Alex was initially a bit concerned or surprised by the level of the material that we were covering, I can now see Alex beginning to feel a greater amount of comfort in the process of problem solving that we have been developing. I think that Alex is now seeing glimpses of how to succeed in the class when he initially felt that the class material was impenetrable. His most recent assessment on free fall and vectors 33.5/40 (83.75%) still showed that he was moving in the right direction from his previous assessment on constant velocity 42/55 (76.36%). Alex made a meeting with me after his second assessment to review and strategize for his next assessment. I hope that Alex will continue to reach out to me so that we can review past material, work through current topics, or create a plan for studying for an upcoming assessment using some of the many resources that are available through the class webpage: practice tests with answers, Loom videos with full solutions, and problems from the book along with solutions.

COMMENT TEXT:
Joey is a great student to have in class. Joey comes in with the passed down knowledge from his brother of what it means to take Honors Physics. At the very least Joey knows that this is a class that requires commitment and consistent work outside of the classroom. For his part Joey has started the year off strong, showing that he was coming to class prepared, ready to learn, and that he is willing to follow up outside of class, using the outside resources available to him on the class website, doing practice tests and checking his work against provided solutions. A point of improvement for Joey would be in his approach to classtime, especially moments where the class is given time for more open-ended problem solving. I have on multiple occasions needed to remind Joey to get back to the task at hand, having found him drawn to a more interesting conversation about unrelated topics, treating the problem solving time as he might time in a common space around friends. With the freedom provided the expectation is that students will take on the responsibility of maintaining focus on the work of the class, not draw their peers into undoubtedly interesting conversations about anything but the physics we are trying to tackle.

COMMENT TEXT:
JJ is a great student to have in class, he is consistently attentive, and ready to learn. Despite his good focus and attention JJ has had a challenging start to the year. On his initial math assessment (17.5/20 87.5%) JJ expressed some concern about some of the math on the second half of the opening assessment where I asked students to manipulate unfamiliar variables using algebraic rules, developing these skills will become more important as we move through the remainder of the year, so I encourage JJ to come meet with me to review some of these rules and how to get into the habit of using variables only rather than relying on plugging in values. On his most recent assessment on Free fall and vectors (32/40 80%) JJ struggled with identifying different types of values using units, sometimes using meters when the value was a velocity or vice versa. I hope that JJ will come meet with me a few times so that we can clarify some of these points of confusion about essential skills as they are going to be used throughout the remainder of the year. I am encouraged because JJ seems open to feedback and ready to adjust his work. I hope to see JJ during a shared free block or during opposite lunch in the near future!

COMMENT TEXT:
Jesse has commented that Honors Physics makes his brain hurt a bit, a review that I have taken as a compliment, stating that he needs a three hour break before thinking about physics again. I have enjoyed having Jesse in the class as he always brings interesting philosophical questions with him to the class. Jesse's confidence has fluctuated as the interim has progressed. Jesse had a successful first assessment and asked to meet with me before our most recent assessment. Jesse made a meeting with me to review before our most recent assessment but when he arrived he insisted that he felt "pretty confident" after the review that he did on his own. Jesse ended up scoring a 35.5/40 (88%) which seemed below the confidence he expressed right before taking it. I encourage Jesse to follow up, even if he feels confident; more review can never hurt! I hope that Jesse will continue to bring his interesting questions to class, and hopefully as the material and processes become more familiar, Honors Physics will start to feel a bit more comfortable.

COMMENT TEXT:
Michael has had a strong start to the year. Michael seems to have a knack for approaching physics problems, even unfamiliar ones, breaking them down and approaching them methodically, expressing his work neatly and clearly on the page. While there are small details that can be improved in his work Michael often has the bigger picture clearly expressed with his detailed diagrams and well-organized work. I encourage Michael to share more during classtime, both in working with his neighbor as well as with the wider classroom, as he could personally benefit his own understanding by expressing his understanding verbally as well as enhance the learning of his classmates with his insights into approaching problem solving. I am looking forward to the remainder of the semester with Michael.
