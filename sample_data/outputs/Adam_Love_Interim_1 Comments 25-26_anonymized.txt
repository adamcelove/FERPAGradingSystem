ANONYMIZED TEXT:
Will and I have gotten to know each other quickly over the course of the school year; being in the same group on Founders Day certainly helped cement a growing partnership that we seem to be developing. Our "secret" handshake is in its nascent stages of development and we have come to a greater understanding of what is and is not a productive contribution to the classroom. On his assessments Will had a slow start to the year, performing below his expectations on a few of the early assessments, but as the year has progressed Will has seemed to get a better sense of what is expected of him in the class, performing well on his most recent assessment (92%) compared to his previous scores, (72%, 86%, 86%). I think that he is on a positive trajectory and I hope he will continue that trend.  Will reached out to come to meet with me after his assessment on Velocity claiming that "I had put the wrong equation on the test" I had offered for him to come in and discuss so that we could see what happened. As it turned out he had made a simple mistake that he saw as soon as we started reviewing his test. He had made the same mistake on a separate problem, but I do not take off points multiple times for the same mistake, so his grade was only affected by the first instance. Will has had moments where he has been seeking attention from his classmates in ways that are detrimental to the overall learning of the classroom. The good news is that despite some notable moments at the start of the year, it seems that Will has begun a turn for the better as the year has gone on. Will certainly has a talent for making his friends laugh. I hope that he will be able to utilize that power for good, finding the right moments to insert some levity rather than during moments requiring focus and attention from the class. I encourage Will to come meet with me outside of class again during our shared free block so that he can clear up any points of confusion before our next assessment rather than after. I really enjoy having Will in my class and I am looking forward to the rest of the year together!

ANONYMIZED TEXT:
[PERSON_1] has been an outstanding member of our physics class. Already knowing [PERSON_1] from Cross country I know that he is an incredibly hard worker and committed to his own improvement. It does not come as any surprise that that same level of commitment would also translate into his academic work. [PERSON_1] has been an excellent participant in class, showing that he is paying close attention and applying the knowledge to his assessments. For the first weeks of class [PERSON_1] had a 100% and only recently broke his streak.   [PERSON_1] only missed some small details, mistaking a + for a - sign on his most recent assessment but the overall understanding that he has shown has been excellent throughout. I encourage [PERSON_1] to keep up the good work!

Trip has been committed to his studies from the start of the interim. Making an effort to reach out to me to make sure that he was completing all of his work, was making good preparations for his upcoming assessments, and was preparing effectively and meeting with me before one of his assessments to make sure that he was understanding correctly. [PERSON_2]'s hard work and attention to detail has paid off, he scored highly on all of  his assessments . I encourage Trip to continue to reach out for clarification, continue to utilize the resources of the class, and to reach out for help when needed. I am looking forward to the rest of the semester!

ANONYMIZED TEXT:
[PERSON_3] had a bit of a slow start to the year with his surgery and recovery causing him to miss school and then having to write with his hand in a sling. He has proved resilient and adaptable in the face of a challenging situation and was able to catch up despite the days he missed at the start of school. When we met towards the beginning of the semester [PERSON_3] sometimes seemed surprised when asked to provide his thoughts or is asked to state what he thinks the next step would be. When homework was assigned that was practice for an upcoming assessment and based on the work that we had done in class, [PERSON_3] was surprised by the fact that "completion" of the assignment involved going back and getting correct answers (with multiple tries). "How am I supposed to figure this out?" [PERSON_3] commented, indicating some real frustration when it came to working independently. I am here to help him develop those skills he needs to “figure this out” on his own.  I really hope that he will take advantage of working with me in person again, as he may get more out of working one on one if he is still confused about how to approach the materials provided online. When he asked to meet with me towards the end of the first interim during our shared free block, he instead chose to go and try to work on his own and watch a video that I had posted that reviewed the topic. I am more than happy to clarify any confusion and help him work through any frustrations he may be having, he is not alone in his journey to understand the material! I look forward to the rest of the semester with [PERSON_3] and I hope that he knows that I am here to support him in any way that he needs.

[PERSON_4] has shown flashes of understanding and is always working to understand the material to the best of his ability. He is attentive during class and will contribute occasionally to classroom discussions. [PERSON_4] seems to second guess himself on assessments, often erasing his initial work, which by itself would not be a bad sign. [PERSON_4] seems to mix up some small details in his work, forgetting units or putting the wrong units for values or having his work written in such a way that it is hard to understand, either messy to the point of illegibility or hard to follow, I recommend that he write his work with a clear left to right or top to bottom order. I would encourage [PERSON_4] to practice writing out his notes carefully and neatly during class time to practice how he is showing his work on the page during assessments. I look forward to seeing [PERSON_4]’s continued improvement in the class!

[PERSON_5] has had a strong first interim. [PERSON_5] will pick his moments to contribute to discussions asking pointed questions and offering his thoughts. [PERSON_5] has shown good understanding on assessments, often finishing quickly. [PERSON_5] has been able to show his work efficiently, but perhaps too efficiently, showing correct calculations with values; I ask that [PERSON_5] take his time and show more of what he understands on the page, writing down relationships in terms of variables first before plugging in specific numbers from a problem. I hope that [PERSON_5] will continue to speak up in class as his contributions are often valuable. and I hope that he will take his time and show his understanding fully on upcoming assessments as well as other contributions.

[PERSON_6] has had a strong first interim, showing good understanding throughout the interim and having a particularly strong showing on his last assessment. managing to solve the challenge problem at the end using a valid, albeit much longer method to extrapolate the motion of a speeding car beyond the given information. I encourage [PERSON_6] to continue to try creative solutions to problems and see how he can apply his math skills to more problems that we encounter. [PERSON_6] has done well to resist the distractions of peers around him, maintaining focus even while his peers may be seeking his attention. MacPhail, [PERSON_7] has been a solid member of the class, keeping up with assignments and reaching out to make sure that he has been keeping up with the current material. [PERSON_8] is great at asking questions during class time. His questions often show that he is thinking deeply, considering the work that we are doing and identifying a specific part that he is getting stuck at. [PERSON_8] has shown that he is getting the big picture on many of his assessments, the few points that he has missed often come from small details, applying a formula incorrectly, missing a sign or mistaking units. I encourage [PERSON_8] to try to ask the same good questions of his own work, going over his responses and asking himself if he has included all of the necessary details. I am looking forward to the remainder of the first semester with [PERSON_8]!

[PERSON_9] and I have seemed to develop a good rapport over the first interim. [PERSON_9] always seems to have a smile on his face, is very personable and has shown that he is a very capable student with his work on class time activities, labs and assessments. I would encourage [PERSON_9] to continue to consider some of his class time behavior more closely. I am sure that [PERSON_9] hasn't been intentional in trying to be discouraging but I have heard him make some offhand comments to his neighbor during problem solving, when he noticed a mistake in his partner's work. I would encourage [PERSON_9] to reconsider our guidelines for peer feedback: specific, helpful and kind so that he can provide kind and encouraging assistance especially to someone he considers a friend. Early in the interim [PERSON_9] and his friend seemed to consistently strike up a conversation as soon as I would turn my back when I was presenting to the class. After pointing this out to them, they both seemed to get the message that side conversations during class time, even when the teacher's back is turned, are not appropriate. I have seen good improvement since I pointed out what I had noticed to [PERSON_9]. Overall, I have very much enjoyed having [PERSON_9] as a student. After his most recent absence [PERSON_9] was very diligent to make a meeting to review material that he missed and prepared for the most recent assessment which he performed well on. I look forward to the rest of the semester with [PERSON_9]!

[PERSON_10] made a good effort to make up a lab that he had missed at the start of the interim, making an appointment to come outside of class to gather his data, make the necessary measurements and write up his report after missing school for a few days. [PERSON_10] struggled on his most recent assessment on acceleration, showing some weakness on the graphing portion as well as with definitions that were reviewed in the prior class. [PERSON_10] has seemed confused during portions of class at least from his expressions but rarely asks a question for clarification. I encourage [PERSON_10] to ask more questions during class when he is confused and to reach out for help outside of class when he is feeling persistent confusion. I am always available to meet the opposite lunch. [PERSON_10] has at times struggled with staying focused during class time often leaning back in his chair rather than taking notes or practicing the skill we are investigating. I encourage [PERSON_10] to "lean in" both literally and figuratively in class so that he doesn't miss important details. I hope that [PERSON_10] and I can continue to partner in his development.

[PERSON_11] has been a positive member of the classroom aside from a few chuckles at inappropriate times and trying to draw the attention of friends from across the room [PERSON_11] has been an engaged member of the classroom. When [PERSON_11] gets down to work he works with focus and purpose. Outside of class [PERSON_11] is easy to talk to and get along with. [PERSON_11] has struggled a fair bit on his assessments, having trouble applying many of the skills of the class. On his most recent assessment [PERSON_11] was asked about features on a specific graph and what they represented. [PERSON_11] gave general responses that were true for a graph in general but were not applicable to the specific graph that we had been working with for the past few weeks showing that he was perhaps missing an important connection between describing the motion of an object and how it connects to the features of the graph of that same motion. I hope that [PERSON_11] will reach out to make a meeting with me to review concepts that he is struggling with. I know that [PERSON_11] is a capable student and that he is working hard to improve. I am here to help meet whatever goals [PERSON_11] has for his performance in the class.

I have really enjoy having TJ in my class, he is a wonderful presence in the room and is always respectful and ready to learn. I encourage TJ to talk readily with his partner and try to work through problems together especially if he is unsure. TJ struggled on his most recent assessment on acceleration. I had provided a video on how to draw graphs which was direct practice for the first part of the quiz. I encourage TJ to go back and review that material as that will be a skill that we will continue to use throughout the coming units. I have noticed that he has been slow to come back from breaks at times and has had a habit of forgetting to place his phone in the holder at the start of class though he has improved as the interim has continued. I encourage TJ to focus on making sure that he is taking care of the basics, showing up to class on time, placing his phone in the holder right away and having his notes out and ready right at the start of class. I hope that TJ will reach out to me if he feels like he needs some additional review before assessments, will take the opportunity to review with his partner during group work time as well as utilize all of the resources available to him outside of class time.

Staying focused during class work time, showing good preparation during assessments, writing out his work completely, writing detailed and specific responses to questions, and checking over his work before handing anything in. [PERSON_12]'s only points of improvement lie in becoming distracted at times by his peers, sometimes laughing along with a joke provided by his classmates but he is quick to refocus when reminded.

It has been great to get to know [PERSON_13] over the course of the year. Sitting at the seat closest to my desk has allowed us to check in more often. [PERSON_13] had asked me at the start of the year to share [SCHOOL_NAME_1] football highlight tape, something that his brother had shared that I had placed in my midterm study materials in previous years. I am sure that patience will pay off for [PERSON_13] in this respect. Academically [PERSON_13] has shown good preparation for his assessments, showing a bit of a dip in performance on his assessments but ended the interim with a perfect score on one of the most challenging assessments of the interim. I hope that [PERSON_13] continues with his strong performances and with his excellent work discussing problems with his neighbors. In overhearing some of his conversations with his partner, [PERSON_13] is always open-minded and willing to change his mind if he is able to see the value behind his partner's argument.

[PERSON_14] has reached out to meet with me, making meetings before school asking for additional practice, clarifying instructions, and overall giving himself the greatest opportunity to succeed in the class. [PERSON_14] has not been shy to contribute to discussions, even volunteering to be one of the first discussion directors for his class, taking on the role with gusto, perhaps even going a bit overboard with the formality that he approached the role with. I encourage [PERSON_14] to keep checking in, not to discourage him in his assertive nature but to encourage a measure of questioning before charging ahead and find a balance between stating ideas confidently and expressing a bit of questioning or consideration for where he may need more detail.

[PERSON_15] has been a quiet but diligent member of the class, working well with his partner during group problem solving, showing his work completely during assessments. [PERSON_15] participates occasionally during classroom discussions and I would encourage him to ask more questions and share his thoughts more readily, both to solidify thoughts for himself as well as to help his classmates by sharing his explanations with the full class. [PERSON_15]'s work is often well expressed, specific but he can occasionally miss small details, forgetting to write units or missing a step in a calculation or using a term incorrectly in an explanation. I encourage [PERSON_15] to continue with his good in-class habits and perhaps add some more review of his notes outside of class, additional practice writing out solutions fully, and taking time at the end of assessments to check over his work to make sure that he hasn't left out any important details.

He can be distracted at times by his neighbors, engaging in some side conversations but is quick to correct when he is reminded. [PERSON_16] has also needed some reminders to turn in work or to take a missed assessment. I encourage [PERSON_16] to be proactive, check myUS for any missing assignments.

[PERSON_18] shows good understanding in glimpses on his assessments where he is close to a correct definition or application of a concept but is often missing one more step to solidify his knowledge. On his most recent assessment he showed a good understanding of what was happening during a car accelerating but was confusing how to find displacement with how to find acceleration using a graph that he had produced. [PERSON_18] has become frustrated at times throughout the interim. I have heard [PERSON_18] at times seemingly trying to convince himself that he couldn't possibly understand the material. I encourage [PERSON_18] to slow down in these moments of frustration (there are many challenging concepts in physics) and stay open minded about his abilities and practice self-compassion and not come in with the expectation that everything will be understandable the very first time he encounters something new. On his assessments [PERSON_18] shows that he is understanding the shape of the problems but can confuse terms and his work can be hard to follow logically.

ANONYMIZED TEXT:
Gio has been selective with his participation this interim, speaking up only when he has something he is sure of. Often staying quiet during small group discussion times, while he does seem focused on his work, he often doesn't take the opportunity to try to ask questions, or discuss each activity more deeply with his table partner during group work, discussing briefly and then stopping conversation for the remainder of time allotted for group work. I encourage Gio to reach out both in class with questions as well as to make meetings outside of the classroom before assessments to check his knowledge before he is assessed. Gio scored a 21.5/30 on his Forces quiz, indicating that he will need to review those materials as we come back to the skills that we applied on that assessment. I know that Gio is a capable and hard-working student so I hope that he will take advantage of all of the opportunities to learn both in and out of the classroom, coming to meet with me, using online resources provided on the class website, and watching recorded videos for important concepts.

[PERSON_21] missed some time at school but did very well to follow up as soon as he was back and made a plan for completing his missed work. While [PERSON_21] is the only [GRADE_LEVEL_1] in the class he has adjusted well to a group that he has likely not interacted with extensively during his US career. [PERSON_21] has shown good understanding throughout the interim, performing well on quizzes, offering help to his fellow students and staying focused even in the face of his peers offering easy distractions. [PERSON_21] has forgotten to place his phone in the holder several times this interim. I hope that [PERSON_21] will take the reminder that phones go in the holder as soon as he enters the room; even if I am not in the classroom during the passing period, that is not a time to use his phone while in the classroom. Overall [PERSON_21] has been a strong student and an excellent addition to the classroom. I look forward to the remainder of the semester!

[PERSON_22] has had a bit of a challenging interim. [PERSON_22] is a bit quiet during class and while he seems focused on his work I do see him sitting back during group work times, waiting before trying again or starting a discussion with his partner. I encourage [PERSON_22] to try to channel his thinking into written work and discussion with his partner more readily so that he can solidify his thinking or find a point where he needs to ask a question. [PERSON_22] has struggled on quizzes related to forces, finding it difficult to apply the rules for constructing Interaction and Force diagrams. I encourage [PERSON_22] to go back to the materials that we used for identifying types of forces, when they are present and what direction they will be in, as we will again use those skills in our upcoming unit on mass and weight, friction, and air resistance.

[PERSON_25] has shown good ability to perform on assessments but will often miss details in his work, forgetting a type of force or the direction that force goes in. [PERSON_25] seems to be content to sit back during class time and absorb material for himself, rarely discussing his work with his partner for more than a minute, taking the time to sit back rather than taking time to offer an explanation or asking a question of his partner. I encourage [PERSON_25] to take some time to go a bit further and try to explain his thinking more fully during partner work as he is missing an opportunity both to solidify his own knowledge but also to lend a hand to his classmate and share his understanding. [PERSON_25] has lately seemed determined to use all of the stuff in the classroom for creative purposes, making constructions out of test dividers, using meter sticks instead of rulers for line drawing in a notebook.

He completed some of the review on his own and then met with me to review some of the problems that he found challenging. His continued practice and review outside of class has shown good results and I encourage Phin to continue to apply the strategies that he has developed in review for the past few weeks. Phin has seemed to become more comfortable with the processes of the class and grown in confidence as he has begun to find out how to practice effectively outside of class.

[PERSON_37] came to me after his most recent test and expressed some concerns about his standing in the class and the lack of confidence that he felt after the most recent assessment. We spoke at length about the difference between "natural ability" and "experience" when discussing how he felt relative to the other students in the class. I encourage [PERSON_37] to focus on listening and trying to understand, rather than comparing himself to others. If it seems like others are explaining a concept easily, that is a great opportunity to try and understand what they understand. Everyone has to traverse the gap between not understanding and understanding, but the more we focus on the frustration, the "I am not getting it" or the "natural ability" of those around us the more that we miss the fact that much of what may appear as "natural ability" is just an expression of understanding that was gained from past experience wrestling with the concepts we are investigating. I encourage [PERSON_37] to come and meet with me during our shared free block (G-Block in the Library) in the coming months so that we can review recent material, look ahead to coming topics, and review past knowledge.

[PERSON_42] has been an excellent part of the Honors Physics classroom. [PERSON_42] has seemed to come alive a bit more in class recently when we started investigating some more challenging problems that have ranges of solutions. [PERSON_42] started building models using both problem solving on paper and then using [PERSON_31] to create a computer model of the system to see how the system responded to changes in the various inputs. I hope that [PERSON_42] will continue to follow this practice, applying the same modeling techniques to the new tools that we will be developing over the coming months, using Forces, Energy, and momentum to model the behavior of more complex systems. Khot, Nishanth - INC Nishanth had a bit of a slow start to the year.  He seemed hesitant to apply himself fully to the tasks of the class choosing to sit back rather than move ahead with writing out his work.  When asked about his thought process Nishanth often had interesting and inventive ways of approaching problems, showing good intuition about how the mathematics could be applied to the systems we were investigating.  On assessments Nishanth took only two of the three large assessments scoring a 18/20 and a 45/55.  I hope to see more of Nishanth getting his good thought on to the page and applying his good mathematical and analytical skills to the upcoming semester!

I think that [PERSON_43] is now seeing glimpses of how to succeed in the class when he initially felt that the class material was impenetrable. His most recent assessment on free fall and vectors 33.5/40 (83.75%) still showed that he was moving in the right direction from his previous assessment on constant velocity 42/55 (76.36%). [PERSON_43] made a meeting with me after his second assessment to review and strategize for his next assessment. I hope that [PERSON_43] will continue to reach out to me so that we can review past material, work through current topics, or create a plan for studying for an upcoming assessment using some of the many resources that are available through the class webpage: practice tests with answers, [PERSON_44] videos with full solutions, and problems from the book along with solutions.

[PERSON_45] is a great student to have in class. [PERSON_45] comes in with the passed down knowledge from his brother of what it means to take Honors Physics. At the very least [PERSON_45] knows that this is a class that requires commitment and consistent work outside of the classroom. For his part [PERSON_45] has started the year off strong, showing that he was coming to class prepared, ready to learn, and that he is willing to follow up outside of class, using the outside resources available to him on the class website, doing practice tests and checking his work against provided solutions. A point of improvement for [PERSON_45] would be in his approach to classtime, especially moments where the class is given time for more open-ended problem solving. I have on multiple occasions needed to remind [PERSON_45] to get back to the task at hand, having found him drawn to a more interesting conversation about unrelated topics, treating the problem solving time as he might time in a common space around friends. With the freedom provided the expectation is that students will take on the responsibility of maintaining focus on the work of the class, not draw their peers into undoubtedly interesting conversations about anything but the physics we are trying to tackle.

[PERSON_46] is a great student to have in class, he is consistently attentive, and ready to learn. Despite his good focus and attention [PERSON_46] has had a challenging start to the year. On his initial math assessment (17.5/20 87.5%) [PERSON_46] expressed some concern about some of the math on the second half of the opening assessment where I asked students to manipulate unfamiliar variables using algebraic rules, developing these skills will become more important as we move through the remainder of the year, so I encourage [PERSON_46] to come meet with me to review some of these rules and how to get into the habit of using variables only rather than relying on plugging in values. On his most recent assessment on Free fall and vectors (32/40 80%) [PERSON_46] struggled with identifying different types of values using units, sometimes using meters when the value was a velocity or vice versa. I hope that [PERSON_46] will come meet with me a few times so that we can clarify some of these points of confusion about essential skills as they are going to be used throughout the remainder of the year. I am encouraged because [PERSON_46] seems open to feedback and ready to adjust his work. I hope to see [PERSON_46] during a shared free block or during opposite lunch in the near future!

[PERSON_47] has commented that Honors Physics makes his brain hurt a bit, a review that I have taken as a compliment, stating that he needs a three hour break before thinking about physics again. I have enjoyed having [PERSON_47] in the class as he always brings interesting philosophical questions with him to the class. [PERSON_47]'s confidence has fluctuated as the interim has progressed. [PERSON_47] had a successful first assessment and asked to meet with me before our most recent assessment. [PERSON_47] made a meeting with me to review before our most recent assessment but when he arrived he insisted that he felt "pretty confident" after the review that he did on his own. [PERSON_47] ended up scoring a 35.5/40 (88%) which seemed below the confidence he expressed right before taking it. I encourage [PERSON_47] to follow up, even if he feels confident; more review can never hurt! I hope that [PERSON_47] will continue to bring his interesting questions to class, and hopefully as the material and processes become more familiar, Honors Physics will start to feel a bit more comfortable.

[PERSON_20] has had a strong start to the year. [PERSON_20] seems to have a knack for approaching physics problems, even unfamiliar ones, breaking them down and approaching them methodically, expressing his work neatly and clearly on the page. While there are small details that can be improved in his work [PERSON_20] often has the bigger picture clearly expressed with his detailed diagrams and well-organized work. I encourage [PERSON_20] to share more during classtime, both in working with his neighbor as well as with the wider classroom, as he could personally benefit his own understanding by expressing his understanding verbally as well as enhance the learning of his classmates with his insights into approaching problem solving. I am looking forward to the remainder of the semester with [PERSON_20].
